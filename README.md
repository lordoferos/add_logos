# Python Script for Adding Logos to Photos

This script is designed to add logos to photos using the Pillow module in Python. The script allows you to set the position, size, and angle of the logo, and can also be run on thousands of images at once.

# Getting Started

To get started with this script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the Pillow module. You can install Pillow using pip by running the following command:

```{python}
pip install Pillow
```
Once you have Pillow installed, you can run the script using a command line interface or an IDE.

# Usage

To use the script, simply specify the path to the logo image and the path to the image or images that you want to add the logo to. You can also set the position, size, and angle of the logo using the optional arguments.

The script can be run on a single image, or on thousands of images at once. To run the script on multiple images, simply specify a directory containing the images, and the script will add the logo to each image in the directory.
